# Git Training Repo

Hello!

This repository is a training area for Git activities.

To work in this repo, you'll need to fork it. In GitHub, there's a button for
that in the upper right corner of the repo's main page. Forking creates a copy
of the repo that you own, and are allowed to make changes to -- you can't work
on it otherwise. I've set this original repo so that only I can change it, so
you won't be able to work on it directly.

For this exercise, this branch is assumed to be a feature branch. We've
finished developing a new feature, and it's time to merge into another branch.

However, this file and the one in `conflict/target` have been constructed so
that they will cause a merge conflict. This only really occurs when the same
parts of both files are edited, so it shouldn't be very common in practice.
