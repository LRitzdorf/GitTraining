# Git Training Repo

This branch is a target for the rebasing activity.

For this exercise, assume this is a feature branch. We've done significant work
here, and plan to merge into `main` later on. More importantly, we've pushed
this branch to the remote, and have collaborated with other people on it. Thus,
we want to leave its history unchanged, but add onto it.
