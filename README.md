# Git Training Repo

Hello!

This repository is a training area for Git activities.

Here's a change that was added in a different branch. Unless someone chooses to
make an edit in this location on your feature branch, you'll have no merge
conflicts.

This is a change I added to demonstrate how fast-forwarding works.
