# Git Training Repo

Hello!

This repository is a training area for Git activities.

To work in this repo, you'll need to fork it. In GitHub, there's a button for
that in the upper right corner of the repo's main page. Forking creates a copy
of the repo that you own, and are allowed to make changes to -- you can't work
on it otherwise. I've set this original repo so that only I can change it, so
you won't be able to work on it directly.

Here's a change that we don't want to be included in our project's history at
all. Maybe it's an API token or password that someone added by mistake, or
maybe this is a local-only branch that you want to clean up before pushing.

Here are some changes that we *do* want to include in the repo's history.
