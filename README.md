# Git Training Repo

Hello!

This repository is a training area for Git activities.

To work in this repo, you'll need to fork it. In GitHub, there's a button for
that in the upper right corner of the repo's main page. Forking creates a copy
of the repo that you own, and are allowed to make changes to -- you can't work
on it otherwise. I've set this original repo so that only I can change it, so
you won't be able to work on it directly.

This branch is our merge target. Unfortunately, this file has been crafted to
cause a merge conflict with `conflict/source`.

For this exercise, resolve the conflict however you see fit. In practice,
you'll need to combine code, which could be tricky.
